This project here showcases a MIPS Dissasembler that takes binary code and translates it into readable mips code. It takes 27 different instructions including all of I-Type, J-Type, and R-Type instructions. It was a fun project that was extra credit for undergraduates in my Computer Organization class and mandatory for grads so I decided to do it as an undergrad and had a lot of fun building it. Thank you for checking out my project.
